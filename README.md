## Desription
Digital core design for APP ASIC. FPGA code for test PCB.

### Directory Structure 

### Setup (ASIC)
Setup assumes you are running on lxhiggs (CentOS7 with EL7) which is required for the ASIC tools to run. Because of this, we are limited to cocotb v1.3.1.

1. `source .cshrc_Cadence_Linux` to set up the Cadence ASIC tool environment.
2. From the verif/ directory, `./run.sh`.  This will start cocotb, and bring up the Incisive tool (NCSim simulation, and SimVision GUI waveform viewer). 

### Setup (FPGA)

#### Git worflow and building firmware

#### Building petalinux
